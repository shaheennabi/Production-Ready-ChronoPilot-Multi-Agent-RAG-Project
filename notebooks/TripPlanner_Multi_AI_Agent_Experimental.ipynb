Malaysia was once ranked 9th in the world for tourist arrivals. In 2017, the Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report ranked Malaysia 26 out of 141 countries using its Travel & Tourism Competitiveness Index (TTCI) which measures the various components and policies of a country that are in place to allow for the sustainable development of its travel and tourism sectors.\\nIn an effort to diversify Malaysia\\'s economy and reduce its dependency on exports, the government pushed to increase tourism in Malaysia. This led tourism to become Malaysia\\'s second largest source of foreign exchange income. In 2022, tourism contributed 14% to Malaysia\\'s overall GDP.\\nThe government agency in charge of promoting tourism in Malaysia is Tourism Malaysia or the Malaysia Tourism Promotion Board (MTPB). On 20 May 1987, the Ministry of Culture, Arts and Tourism (MOCAT) was established and TDC moved to this new ministry. TDC existed from 1972 to 1992, when it became the Malaysia Tourism Promotion Board (MTPB), through the Malaysia Tourism Promotion Board Act, 1992.\\nIn 1990, Malaysia launched a tourism campaign called \"Fascinating Malaysia. Year of Festivals\" which was considered a success and brought in the arrivals of 7.4 million tourists. Five years later, in 1994, Malaysia launched another campaign themed \"Fascinating Malaysia. Naturally More\" which welcomed 10.22 million tourists. In 2007, Malaysia launched its most notable tourism campaign titled \"Malaysia Truly Asia\". This campaign was launched in conjunction with Malaysia\\'s 50th year of independence and was heavily promoted and advertised. It exceeded expectations and was a massive success, chartering the arrivals of 20.97 million tourists.'}, {'title': 'Tourism Malaysia', 'fullurl': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism_Malaysia', 'snippet': 'Tourism Malaysia or Malaysia Tourism Promotion Board (MTPB) is an agency under the Ministry of Tourism, Arts and Culture, Malaysia.\\nTourism Malaysia, formerly known as the \"Tourist Development Corporation of Malaysia (TDC)\", was established on 10 August 1972.

Malaysia's medical tourism statistics derive from the reported numbers of all foreign patients treated by MHTC-endorsed medical facilities. These figures encompass all registered patients with a foreign passport, which by default also encompass expatriates, migrants, business travellers, and holiday-makers for whom health care may not be the main motive for their stay. The number of MHTC-endorsed medical facilities in Malaysia has increased over the years (e.g., 35 in 2009, 49 in 2011, 63 in 2012, 72 in 2013 and 78 in 2014), playing a role in increasing the official figures on foreign patients.

Malaysia was once ranked 9th in the world for tourist arrivals. In 2017, the Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report ranked Malaysia 26 out of 141 countries using its Travel & Tourism Competitiveness Index (TTCI) which measures the various components and policies of a country that are in place to allow for the sustainable development of its travel and tourism sectors.\\nIn an effort to diversify Malaysia\\'s economy and reduce its dependency on exports, the government pushed to increase tourism in Malaysia. This led tourism to become Malaysia\\'s second largest source of foreign exchange income. In 2022, tourism contributed 14% to Malaysia\\'s overall GDP.\\nThe government agency in charge of promoting tourism in Malaysia is Tourism Malaysia or the Malaysia Tourism Promotion Board (MTPB). On 20 May 1987, the Ministry of Culture, Arts and Tourism (MOCAT) was established and TDC moved to this new ministry. TDC existed from 1972 to 1992, when it became the Malaysia Tourism Promotion Board (MTPB), through the Malaysia Tourism Promotion Board Act, 1992.\\nIn 1990, Malaysia launched a tourism campaign called \"Fascinating Malaysia. Year of Festivals\" which was considered a success and brought in the arrivals of 7.4 million tourists. Five years later, in 1994, Malaysia launched another campaign themed \"Fascinating Malaysia. Naturally More\" which welcomed 10.22 million tourists. In 2007, Malaysia launched its most notable tourism campaign titled \"Malaysia Truly Asia\". This campaign was launched in conjunction with Malaysia\\'s 50th year of independence and was heavily promoted and advertised. It exceeded expectations and was a massive success, chartering the arrivals of 20.97 million tourists.'}, {'title': 'Tourism Malaysia', 'fullurl': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism_Malaysia', 'snippet': 'Tourism Malaysia or Malaysia Tourism Promotion Board (MTPB) is an agency under the Ministry of Tourism, Arts and Culture, Malaysia.\\nTourism Malaysia, formerly known as the \"Tourist Development Corporation of Malaysia (TDC)\", was established on 10 August 1972.

Malaysia's medical tourism statistics derive from the reported numbers of all foreign patients treated by MHTC-endorsed medical facilities. These figures encompass all registered patients with a foreign passport, which by default also encompass expatriates, migrants, business travellers, and holiday-makers for whom health care may not be the main motive for their stay. The number of MHTC-endorsed medical facilities in Malaysia has increased over the years (e.g., 35 in 2009, 49 in 2011, 63 in 2012, 72 in 2013 and 78 in 2014), playing a role in increasing the official figures on foreign patients.
